# **Your**Shore: A mobile application for shoreline exploration

**Your**Shore has been developed to allow community members and groups and other non-specialists to explore and record attributes about their local urban shorelines, covering broad aspects of habitat types, land use and species. With shellfish reefs in significant decline across Australia, a capacity to record the presence of any remnant shellfish reefs has also been included. **Your**Shore data will be validated and used by scientists to assess the health and habitat conditions of urban shorelines across a broad geographic area, as well as to pinpoint locations for possible shellfish restoration.

The more users interact with **Your**Shore, the more useful it will be to scientists and to shoreline conservation and restoration. When using **Your**Shore, please remember to upload any relevant site images and add details about sites in the annotation boxes.

Here at **Your**Shore we are keen to hear about how you use the app and how we can help.

Find our details below.

4. Logging in to **Your**Shore

**Your**Shore requires users to set a username and password. You can set this at the login page. Make sure that your device is online when setting the username and password so that it is recorded. During the data collection you work offline, but if you want to then sync your records, you need to go online. Use the Sync button to sync your settings across the **Your**Shore community when completed.

5. Starting a trip

To start a trip in **Your**Shore, simply click on the ‘Start Trip’ bar that appears after the sign-on page. You will then be taken to the trip page, where tabs will show the three categories of records that can be entered: trip data, shoreline attributes and shellfish aggregations.

|![](files/data/guide/general-tab-group.png)|![](files/data/guide/trip.png)|

For your trip to be recorded in the **Your**Shore database, you will need to enter the following details within the ‘TRIP DATA’ tab:

* **Location**. Make sure your location is being recorded by checking the GPS signal indicator is lit in blue. If it’s grey, make sure to enable the Location on your device (usually via the Settings menu). To record the GPS coordinates, click on the ‘Take From GPS’ button in the Trip Tab and your current Latitude, Longitude, Northing, Easting and Accuracy will be automatically recorded.

* **Region and subregion**. Use the dropdown menus within to select your region.

As well as these details within the ‘SHORELINE ATTRIBUTES’ tab:

* Habitat types, dominant habitat – both natural and artificial

* Adjacent land use

* Presence/absence of wastewater outflows

* Shoreline slope

6. Navigating between the trip and individual observations, and Search

Upon saving a trip (records are autosaved in 3-5 seconds after you finish touching the interface), you can tap the back button and will be brought into the General screen. If you are filling out an Aggregation, a tap on the Back button will take you back into your Trip. Continued tapping of the Back button will make you exit the module and require fresh login. Watch your fingers:)

All saved records can be found in the Search tab which sits next to the General screen. Find your observation by using the filters provided. Search term accepts only the beginning of the alphanumeric string, e.g. you want to find a record ‘2018-04-17 Byron Bay Pacific Oyster’ it searches for ‘2018-04-17’, but not for ‘04-17’. Feel free to experiment with your search terms.

7. Checking for any missing data

To check if you are missing any important data, click on the ‘Check for Missing Data’ button in the Trip / Shoreline Attributes Tab and a list of attributes with missing data will pop-up. You can also verify that no important information is missing by going/swiping to the Navigation pane and clicking the ‘Validate’ button.

8. Recording parameters

#### Shoreline attributes

**Your**Shore first asks you to look around at the shoreline and observe and record its basic features and characteristics. Are you on a beach or a mudflat area? Are you near a playground or sport park, in bushland or near a major road? Are there mainly houses and roads nearby, or are you in an industrial area? What types of animals can you see using the shoreline? These records will help scientists to determine what the habitat *value* of the shoreline is to resident species.

Be sure to only record animals *directly* interacting with the shoreline – e.g. walking on the beach, digging in the sand, diving for fish etc. Do not record domesticated animals such as dogs.

Fill out each field as best you can, adding images or annotated notes where applicable.

#### Shellfish aggregations

The presence of clusters or aggregations or shellfish along your shoreline is important information for restoration scientists. Please carefully record as much data as you can about these aggregations. The following guidelines will help you record the details.

##### Shellfish type and species

Generally, attached shellfish will be one of two major groups – oysters or mussels.

* Mussels are generally smooth-shelled with rounded edges to the shells and are attached by *byssal *threads to the substrate.

* Oysters are most often irregularly shaped, with ‘ruffled’ or irregular shell edges, have layers of shell that are often rough or irregular, and are cemented to the substrate.

Record whether you have a mussel or oyster; refer to the photo gallery if unsure.

Shellfish species can be hard to differentiate in the field but any information is useful! Please use the photo gallery to select the species that most closely resembles those at your site.

Scientists can use your recorded data and photo, along with the location, to make a best estimate of the likely species, and follow up with field validation if required.

##### Primary and surrounding substrate

‘Substrate’ refers to the surface on which the shellfish is sitting.

* We use the term ‘primary substrate’ to denote the surface that the shellfish is *directly* attached to. This will most likely be a rock, pier piling or other hard surface e.g. sea wall.

* The ‘secondary substrate’ is the surface surrounding the aggregation. This can give us an idea of how *available *the primary substrate is to the incoming shellfish larvae.

It can be tricky to determine the surrounding substrate, particularly if the primary substrate is extensive. Upload a photo to assist with our validation.

##### Shellfish status

It is important to determine if the shoreline has conditions to support living shellfish. Live shellfish that are out of the water will generally be firmly closed with both shells intact. Gaping shells or incomplete shells are indicative of dead shellfish.

The photo at left shows a live oyster (left) next to a dead, gaping oyster (right).

At a close distance, observe the shellfish in the aggregation and record their status – do you think most are dead or alive?

If you are unable to observe the shellfish aggregation at a close enough distance, leave this field blank.

##### Distance to water

Observe how far the shellfish aggregation is from a permanent marine or brackish water body. Estimate in metres.

##### Size of aggregation

Use the pictures to help you estimate the numbers of shellfish within an aggregation.

Aggregations can often cover extensive areas horizontally, e.g. along the tidal mark. Make a note of the approximate shape of the aggregation in the annotations for this field and upload a photo.

##### Density of aggregation

Shellfish that are closer together will have a greater chance of reproductive success, so it is important that we record density of aggregations.

To do this, identify an area of the aggregation where the shellfish are most closely packed together. Place your device close to the aggregation and estimate how many individuals fit into the area of your device. Make a note of the type of device in the annotation box. If you cannot closely observe the aggregation, please estimate density and annotate the record with your observations.

In both cases, upload a photo for validation, placing an object such as a coin or rule next to the aggregation for scale.

##### Shellfish photos

Remember to take photos of the shellfish aggregation(s) that you have seen on your trip, as these will help scientists and other users to identify the species and to validate the parameters that you have recorded.

There is no limit to the number of images that can be uploaded to this section of the app, although bear in mind that uploading these images will take time once you are in wifi range.
